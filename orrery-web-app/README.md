# üåå Astral Odyssey

Welcome to our **Astral Odyssey**, a virtual exploration of the solar system that brings celestial mechanics to life! This project was developed as part of the **NASA Space Apps Hack Challenge**, aimed at delivering an engaging and informative experience of the cosmos. Using the latest web technologies, we present an immersive, interactive web app that models celestial bodies in our solar neighborhood, including planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.

## üöÄ Overview

This Orrery application is designed to **educate and fascinate** users by providing a digital, 3D model of our solar system and nearby celestial bodies. Unlike the original mechanical orreries of the 18th century, this web app leverages advanced tools to create a fully interactive and visually compelling representation of space. You can explore planets, asteroids, and comets in real-time, with all objects rendered in three-dimensional space, offering a modern perspective on an ancient concept.

## üåç Features

- **Interactive 3D Celestial Models**: View planets, asteroids, and comets, all modeled in 3D with realistic orbits.
- **Near-Earth Objects**: Stay informed about asteroids and comets that have close encounters with Earth, including Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Easily zoom in/out, rotate, and interact with the celestial models.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Accurate, real-time positions of celestial bodies.
- **Educational Information**: Click on any celestial body for detailed information and fun facts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages a **modern tech stack** to create an immersive and interactive experience:

- **Unity**: Used for crafting high-quality 3D models of planets and asteroids.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that powers the web application, providing both client and server-side rendering.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to render and display animated 3D graphics in a web browser.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better code quality during development.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utilized for rapid and clean styling, making our web interface responsive and visually appealing.
- **Shadcn UI**: A component library used for creating intuitive and modern UI elements.

## üìú Installation Guide

To get started with the Interactive Orrery, follow these steps:

## üéÆ How to Use

- **Navigate Through Space**: Use your mouse to click and drag the 3D space environment to explore different angles.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out, allowing you to focus on particular celestial bodies or pull back for a larger view.
- **Select Celestial Bodies**: Click on any planet, asteroid, or comet to get detailed information, including interesting facts and their current position.

## üîç Challenges Overcome

Creating an interactive orrery web app came with various challenges:

- **Real-Time Celestial Modeling**: Ensuring accurate positioning of celestial bodies required extensive research and implementation of orbital mechanics.
- **Performance Optimization**: Integrating Unity and Three.js, and ensuring the app was smooth and responsive, involved overcoming issues related to 3D rendering and managing assets efficiently.

## üí° Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Data Integration**: We plan to integrate more real-time data sources for enhanced accuracy.
- **VR Compatibility**: In the future, we hope to support VR headsets for an even more immersive experience.
- **Improved UI and Animations**: Expanding UI components and adding more transitions for better user experience.
